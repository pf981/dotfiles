associated with
the current buffer, or the value of the buffer-local-variable 
run-cweave-on-file. I could
make it so that I log onto the gwdu20, if I'm not already on it. If there's no
prefix argument, tex is run on the resulting tex file. Otherwise, if there
is a prefix argument, it's not."

If a prefix argument is used, the resulting C program is compiled. At the moment,
I just use gcc -lm as the compile command. I haven't programmed any way of using make or
compiling a different file."
